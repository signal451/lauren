  The program provided allows you to write to a file and read what you wrote from it. Try playing around with it and see if you can break it! Connect to the program with netcat:  
  `[0;33m$[0m nc saturn.picoctf.net [0;90m[PORT][0m{:ansi}`
</Challenge>

<InfoBox type="warning">
  Warning: This is an **instance-based** challenge. Port info will be redacted alongside the last eight characters of the flag, as they are dynamic.
</InfoBox>

Let's connect to the server using `netcat` to see what's going on:
```ansi
[0;33m$[0m nc saturn.picoctf.net [0;90m[PORT][0m
Hi, welcome to my echo chamber!
Type '1' to enter a phrase into our database
Type '2' to echo a phrase in our database
Type '3' to exit the program
```

Since this is the binary exploitation category, we'll be looking for a vulnerability in the source code that allows us to either break or control the program at a lower level. Let's view the attachment `program-redacted.c`:

```c title="program-redacted.c" caption="Inspecting provided source code" showLineNumbers

    if( l <= 0 )
    {
      printf("'l' for tgetinput must be greater than 0\n");
      return -2;
    }

    if (ready_for_reading == -1) {
        /* Some error has occured in input */
        printf("Unable to read your input\n");
        return -1;
    }

        }
        if(read_bytes==0){
            printf("No data given.\n");
            return -4;
        } else {
            return 0;
        }
    } else {
        printf("Timed out waiting for user input. Press Ctrl-C to disconnect\n");
        return -3;
    }

    return 0;
}


static void data_write() {
  char input[100];
  char len[4];
  long length;

  r = tgetinput(input, 100);
  // Timeout on user input
  if(r == -3)

    }

  strcpy(data[inputs], input);

}

    if(r == -3)
    {

      exit(0);
    }
    
    if ((command = strtol(input, NULL, 10)) == 0) {
      puts("Please put in a valid number");
    } else if (command == 1) {
      data_write();
      puts("Write successful, would you like to do anything else?");
    } else if (command == 2) {
      if (inputs == 0) {
        puts("No data yet");
        continue;
      }
      data_read();
      puts("Read successful, would you like to do anything else?");
    } else if (command == 3) {
      return 0;
    } else {
      puts("Please type either 1, 2 or 3");
      puts("Maybe breaking boundaries elsewhere will be helpful");
    }
  }

  return 0;
}
```

In the midst of this complex program, we need to figure out where the flag is, and how to trigger it to print:

```c title="program-redacted.c" caption="Inspecting provided source code" showLineNumbers{16}
static const char* flag = "[REDACTED]";
// [!code skip:16:142]
  if ((entry_number = strtol(entry, NULL, 10)) == 0) {
    puts(flag);
    fseek(stdin, 0, SEEK_END);
    exit(0);
  }
```

The flag is defined in line 13 as `"[REDACTED]"{:c}`, which will be the actual location on the remote server. From lines 139-143 it looks like a condition needs to be met in order to `puts(){:c}` the flag, which writes a string to the output stream `stdout`.

Google defines `strtol(){:c}` as a function that "converts the initial part of the string in **str** to a **long int** value according to the given **base**". To break it, we need to input something that is **unconvertible into a long integer**. In this case, it would be a string, as they can't be properly coalesced into long integers!

This if statement is located within a function called `data_read(){:c}`. Let's see where it's called in the program:

```c title="program-redacted.c" caption="Inspecting provided source code" showLineNumbers{179}
    } else if (command == 2) {
      if (inputs == 0) {
        puts("No data yet");
        continue;
      }
      data_read();
      puts("Read successful, would you like to do anything else?");
```

After we write some data with the command `1`, We should be pressing the command `2` to read from the stored data. Once it prompts us to "enter the entry number of your data", we'll send a string instead to break it. Let's head back to the `netcat` and test it out:

```ansi showLineNumbers /picoCTF{M4K3_5UR3_70_CH3CK_Y0UR_1NPU75_[0;31m[REDACTED][0m}/
[0;33m$[0m nc saturn.picoctf.net 50366
